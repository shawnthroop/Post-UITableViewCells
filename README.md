Post-UITableViewCells
=====================

I'm trying to create a UITableViewCell that gets its height from the data it's displaying. Many examples use UILabels with plain text, Mine are using attributed text strings. Right now im working on recognising taps, its passable but only because I'm using a UILabel to catch touches to query a NSLayoutManager that doesnt actually put text on the screen.

I've gotten most of my ideas from this [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18746929/using-auto-layout-in-uitableview-for-dynamic-cell-layouts-heights) and [caoimghgin's code](https://github.com/caoimghgin/TableViewCellWithAutoLayout) that is referenced in the SO comments.


Please forgive my horrible code and copious errors.
